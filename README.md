# EcIA
This project contains all raw data and R analysis for the September 2023 ecological impact assessment on Arran.

Data were divided into excel sheets by group/taxon for ease of analysis. You will find all clearly labelled in this repository.

Data follows FAIR principles:

FINDABLE on my GitHub profile with the correct link.
ACCESSIBLE for any other users to download and manipulate.
INTEROPARABLE as others are able to exchange and make use of the information I have provided.
REUSABLE as all the data follows the exact same format complying with the Darwin core layout, which makes it easily interpretable and reusable.
